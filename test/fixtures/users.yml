# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  email: "teste@teste.com"
  password: "12345678"
  name: "John Doe"

# column: value
#
two: {}
#  column: value
